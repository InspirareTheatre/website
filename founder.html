After college Laura performed            in local storefronts and spent several years doing musicals and improv        with Chicago's Night Light Playhouse.</p>        <p> <b>While producing            and directing in California</b>, Laura studied for her Masters in Drama            at San Francisco State University with a focus  on actor coaching.            Laura's thesis project explored the use of stylized movement in the            rehearsal process. She worked with her actors for months performing            Indian postures to see their effect on actor &quot;focus&quot; and &quot;stage        presence.&quot;</p>        <p><b>Her studies in a PhD program at UC Davis</b> also investigated            the power of physical disciplines on actor training. Laura studied        the work of Grotowski and the Russian director V. Meyerhold. </p>        <p>          <b>Laura taught theatre and directed for over ten years            in California and Illinois.</b> Most recently she was  Artistic Director/Theatre            Professor        at Sauk Valley College.</p>        <p>          In recent years Laura has focused more on playwriting            and less on directing -- but the need to direct persists.
